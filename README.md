# Task 2: Elevvo Pathways Internship

Welcome to the Task 2 repository for the Elevvo Pathways Internship program.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using machine learning techniques. The main objective is to analyze customer data and group customers into distinct segments based on their annual income and spending score.

### About the Project

For Task 2, I built a software application that performs customer segmentation. The primary method used is the KMeans clustering algorithm, which helps identify patterns and groupings within the data. As a bonus, the DBSCAN clustering method is also implemented to explore alternative segmentation approaches.

Key objectives include:
- Understanding and applying clustering algorithms for customer segmentation.
- Writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Using version control effectively.
- Demonstrating the ability to test and debug applications.
